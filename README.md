# Neo4j OpenFlights Graph

A graph analysis project built with **Neo4j** using the **OpenFlights** dataset to model airport connectivity and flight routes.

## Project Overview

This project models a global air transport network as a graph in Neo4j.

The project was built in two stages:

An extended model with airlines:
- **nodes**: `Airline`
- **nodes**: `Route`
- new relationships:
  - `(:Airline)-[:OPERATES]->(:Route)`
  - `(:Route)-[:FROM]->(:Airport)`
  - `(:Route)-[:TO]->(:Airport)`

This version supports analysis such as:
- airlines operating the most routes
- airlines with the widest international coverage
- airlines operating from a given airport
- a more detailed structure of the air transport network

---
- **Nodes** represent airports
- **Relationships** represent direct routes between airports

The goal is to use graph modeling and Cypher queries to explore:

- major airport hubs
- domestic vs international connectivity
- shortest paths between airports
- airports with the widest international reach
- route network structure
- and more insightful analyses


### Final cleaned files

- `airports_clean.csv`
- `airports_graph.csv`
- `routes_clean.csv`
- `routes_graph.csv`

## Data Cleaning

### Airports cleaning decisions

For `airports.dat`:

- converted `\N` values to null
- kept only rows where `type = "airport"`
- removed rows missing critical fields:
  - `airport_id`
  - `name`
  - `country`
  - `latitude`
  - `longitude`
- used `airport_id` as the primary key
- kept optional missing values like `iata`, `city`, and timezone fields

### Routes cleaning decisions

For `routes.dat`:

- converted `\N` values to null
- removed rows with missing source or destination airport IDs
- removed rows whose airport IDs were not found in the cleaned airport table
- removed self-loop routes
- removed exact duplicate rows
- created `routes_graph.csv` as the graph-ready route file


## Analysis Results

This section shows example results generated from the Neo4j graph after importing the cleaned OpenFlights airport and route data.

### 1. Top 10 Airport Hubs

This query identifies the most connected airports in the graph by total route degree.

**Main insight:**  
The graph highlights major global hubs such as ATL, ORD, PEK, LHR, CDG, FRA, LAX, DFW, JFK, and AMS.

### 2. Domestic vs International Routes

This query compares routes that stay within the same country against routes that cross country borders.

**Main insight:**  
The network contains both strong domestic and international connectivity, with international routes slightly exceeding domestic ones.

---

### 4. Shortest Path Between Two Airports

This query finds the shortest route path between two selected airports in the graph.

**Main insight:**  
In this example, the graph shows a direct 1-hop path between John F. Kennedy International Airport and Mohammed V International Airport.

### 5. Graph Visualization 40 Airport Hubs

This visualization shows a sample airport-route subgraph inside Neo4j Browser.

**Main insight:**  
The graph structure clearly reveals hub-and-spoke connectivity patterns, with highly connected airports acting as central nodes.
